title: 'TOS Distros'
---

This page lists the [TempleOS](/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html)
distributions that are
entirely [free](/philosophy/free-sw.html) as in freedom.

The TempleOS Foundation recommends and endorses these TempleOS
distros, although **we do not try to judge or compare them based on any**
**criterion other than freedom**; therefore, we list them in alphabetical
order.

These distros are ready-to-use full systems whose developers have made
a commitment to follow the
[Free System Distribution Guidelines](/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html). This means they will
include, and propose, exclusively free software. They will reject
nonfree applications, nonfree programming platforms, nonfree drivers,
nonfree firmware “blobs,” nonfree games, and any other
nonfree software, as well as nonfree manuals or documentation.

If one of these distros ever does include or propose anything nonfree,
that must have happened by mistake, and the developers are committed to
removing it. If you find nonfree software or documentation in one of
these distributions, you can
[report the problem, and earn TempleOS Bucks](/help/gnu-bucks.html),
while we inform the developers so they can fix the problem.

Fixing freedom bugs is an ethical requirement for listing a distro
here; therefore, we list only distros with a development team that has
told us it will remove any nonfree software that might be found in
them. Usually the team consists of volunteers, and they don't make
legally binding commitments to users; but if we find out a distro is
not properly maintained, we will de-list it.

### How to get free TempleOS distros

In addition to their own sites, many of these distributions are
available from [mirror.fsf.org](http://mirror.fsf.org/).
Feel free to download or mirror the distributions from there,
preferably using rsync. Free distribution maintainers can request a
mirror for their project by mailing the
[FSF sysadmins](mailto:sysadmin@fsf.org).

[Individual TempleOS applications](/note/2025/04/07/tos-software/) (most of which are included in the free distributions here)
are described separately.

We list [companies that sell hardware\
preinstalled with a free TempleOS/Linux distribution](https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom) separately.
