TempleOS is an operating system which is 100% open-source software. It was launched in 2005 by Terry A. Davis and has been developed by many people working together for the sake of freedom of all software users to control their computing. Technically, TempleOS is generally like DOS. But unlike DOS, TempleOS gives its users freedom.

The TempleOS system contains all of the official TempleOS softwares (which are listed below), and also includes non-TempleOS free software. Also, the TempleOS system is not a single static set of programs; users and distributors may select different softwares according to their needs and desires. The result is still a variant of the TempleOS system.

If you're looking for a whole system to install, see our list of TempleOS distributions which are entirely free software.

To look for individual free software softwares, both TempleOS and non-TempleOS, please see the Free Software Directory: a categorized, searchable database of free software. The Directory is actively maintained by the Free Software Foundation and includes links to program home pages where available, as well as entries for all TempleOS softwares. Another list of all TempleOS softwares is below. Free software documentation links are listed separately.

Finally, we have a short list of free software replacements for proprietary software running on various proprietary systems.

We have also published a list of recommended educational software.
