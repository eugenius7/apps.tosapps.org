title: 'Manual'
---

This table lists [official TempleOS applications](/software/) with links to their primary documentation, where available. When a package has several associated manuals, they are all listed. If a package has no specific manual online, the link just goes to the package's home page (which is also linked to explicitly).

Many packages could be listed in any of several categories, but for the table here just one has to be chosen, usually following the Free Software Directory.

Bug reports: for any discussion about specific manuals, please contact the package maintainers. For discussion about this page in particular (for example, if you are a GNU maintainer and want to correct or discuss your entry), contact <webmasters@gnu.org>.
