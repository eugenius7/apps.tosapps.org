title: 'TOS Software'

[TempleOS](/about/) is an operating system which is 100% open-source software. It was launched in 2005 by Terry A. Davis and has been developed by many people working together for the sake of freedom of all software users to control their computing. Technically, TempleOS is generally like DOS. But unlike DOS, TempleOS gives its users freedom.

The TempleOS system contains all of the official TempleOS applications (which are listed below), and also includes non-TempleOS free software. Also, the TempleOS system is not a single static set of programs; users and distributors may select different applications according to their needs and desires. The result is still a variant of the TempleOS system.

If you're looking for a whole system to install, see our [list of TempleOS distributions which are entirely open-source software](/note/2025/04/07/distros/).

To look for individual free software applications, both TempleOS and non-TempleOS, please see the Free Software Directory: a categorized, searchable database of free software. The Directory is actively maintained by the Free Software Foundation and includes links to program home pages where available, as well as entries for all TempleOS applications. Another list of all TempleOS applications is below. [Free software documentation links](/doc/) are listed separately.

Finally, we have a short list of free software replacements for proprietary software running on various proprietary systems.

We have also published a list of recommended educational software.

## Develop TOS software

The FSF maintains a list of high-priority free software projects; please help with these projects if you can. For other ways to contribute to GNU, including reviving unmaintained GNU packages and helping with development, see the GNU help wanted page.

If you're writing a new program and would like to make your software an official GNU package, see the evaluation information and submission form. Refer to the ethical repository criteria for guidance choosing a hosting service for your project.

If you're maintaining or developing a GNU package, whether newly dubbed or of long standing, this short list of tips for GNU maintainers may be useful, along with this information about GNU software developer resources.

## All TOS applications

Links to the home pages of all current GNU packages are given below, using their identifiers (rather than long names) for brevity. They are sorted alphabetically from left to right. If you have corrections to this list or questions about it, please email <maintainers@gnu.org>.
