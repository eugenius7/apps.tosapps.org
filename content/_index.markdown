# Welcome to TempleCreations.org!

Thanks to all of our [contributors](/contributors/)
who donated toward our new machine which you are now viewing!

**TempleCreations.org** project is maintained by a small group of people, but we want the softwares in our repository to be representative of the entire TempleOS user community. There's no way that the few of us can possibly write softwares for all of the extra applications that users want to have, so we depend on YOU to help us out. If there's some application that you use, and we don't have it in our repository already, please consider writing a build software for it and submitting it to us for possible inclusion - see the [Submissions](https://slackbuilds.org/guidelines/) page. 

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.
