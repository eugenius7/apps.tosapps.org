### GNU documentation principles

We believe the reader should be free to copy, update, and
redistribute GNU documentation, just like GNU software.

Originally, all our documentation was released under a short [copyleft](/licenses/licenses.html#WhatIsCopyleft) license, or
under the [GNU General Public\
License (GPL)](/licenses/licenses.html#GPL). In 2001, the [GNU Free Documentation License\
(FDL)](/licenses/licenses.html#FDL) was created to address needs that were not met by licenses
originally designed for software. For more information on free
documentation, please see [Richard\
Stallman's](https://www.stallman.org/) essay, “ [Free\
Software and Free Manuals.](/philosophy/free-doc.html)” A [Texinfo version of that essay](/doc/freemanuals.texi) is available
for inclusion in manuals.
